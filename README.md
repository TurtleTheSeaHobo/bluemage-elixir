# Bluemage

Code for the ACES RED 2A/COMPUTER "Bluemage" experiment package. Re-implemented from the original Python for version for improved
stability, recoverability, and performance on low-power devices (such as the Raspberry Pi Zero).

## Installation

If [available in Hex](https://hex.pm/docs/publish), the package can be installed
by adding `bluemage` to your list of dependencies in `mix.exs`:

```elixir
def deps do
  [
    {:bluemage, "~> 0.1.0"}
  ]
end
```
